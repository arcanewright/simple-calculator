# Simple Calculator with Create React App
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

You can find the live calculator at [Simple Calculator](https://simplecalculator.arcanewright.com/)

## What is this?
It's a simple calculator. You should be able to use a keyboard for input, as well as manually clicking the numbers. 

## Why did you create this?
I find myself making half a dozen projects every month. Most of them don't see completion. This was supposed to be a simple project I could see through to the end; to that end, it was successful - I feel comfortable publishing it.

## What did you learn?
I learned a lot about RegEx, which I wasn't expecting, but allowing the user to type in strings of operations required searching through that string. I also learned a little more about processes in general - I'm more aware of my bad habits, such as piling all the code in one function, and seeing first hand how that hurts me in the long run.
